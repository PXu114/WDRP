## Notes

1. `FinalPresentation.pdf` is the slides I used for the presentation at the end of the Washington Direct Reading Program I participated. Particularly, I explained the concept and application of Discrete Morse Theory in a research paper in a professional manner.
2. For the background knowledge, I used *Discrete Morse Theory* written by Nicholas A. Scoville and *Topology for Computing* written by Afar J. Zomorodian.
3. The research paper I read and mentioned above is linked [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6134731).
